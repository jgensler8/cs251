I have included a make file name "expand_makefile"

it depends on three .c files:
  1: mutex_ll.c
  2: line.c
  3: hmap.c

simply run
  make -f expand_makefile build
  ./eXeC
OR
  (FOR USE WITH VALGRIND)
  make -f expand_makefile build
  make -f expand_makefile debug


there are several test files in the directory

file
 |
 |- list 1
 |  |
 |  |- list 2
 |
 |-list 2
 |
 |-cyclic1 (optional)
 |  |
 |  |-cyclic2
 |     |
 |     |-...etc...
 |
