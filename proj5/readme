What to do:  read the files bst.h and bst.c.  In bst.h 
you will find a number of tasks flagged with "TODO".

There is also a file called "checklist" which you will
fill out to give Alessandro and idea of the status of your
submission.  

Everything should follow from there.

BUT, notice that the support for incremental size-balancing
has been made a bonus feature due to time constraints.

If you end up doing some significant work on the size
balancing feature, but are worried that it isn't working
AND therefore might break some of your other functions, 
please submit TWO versions -- one with balancing and one
without.

This will make it much easier to ensure that you receive
the credit you deserve for the required portions.
