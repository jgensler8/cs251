For each of the TODOs below, select one of the following:

    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

    (ii) I wrote code for it, but not sure it works all of
         the time.

    (iii)  Did not attempt / submit

    Feel free to add any comments you feel are relevant to 
    the grading process.

**** Comments:
  My solution does not appear to have any memory leaks.
  The size balance capability should work. I have tested it
  by adding 3000 random values which resulted in no leaks and
  apparently correct distribution. The only part my addition *might* fail
  are in the event of empty trees.

(1) iterative version of insert
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(2) Modified data structures and necessary functions
    to support bst_size in constant time.
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(3) Completed the post-order printing function enabling
    visualization of the tree.
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(4) Completed bst_ith_smallest function
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(5) Completed bst_num_in_range function
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(6) Completed bst_extract_range function
    (i)  I completed it and am confident in correctness

(7) Completed size-balanced capability (bonus)
    (ii) I wrote code for it, but not sure it works all of
         the time. (PERHAPS EDGE CASES)
