We know that for and undirected graph if $\exists E(u,v)$ then $\exists E(v,u)$. This is also true for a vertex pointing to itself (it gets counted twice). We also know that the edge set $E_k$ can't get smaller with the addition of vertex $V_{k+1}$. This means the addition of any edges by vertex $V_{k+1}$ may grow the set or may not grow the set. With all of this being said, $deg(V_{k+1})$ could equal to 0 or 2 or 4 ... or 2k verticies.

The edges are stored in the adjacency list. BFS utilizes these edges to do its job. No edges equals no BFS, which is the expected outcome. Because BFS must take a step by step approach, the ordering of the edges matters and a construction of a shortest path because of this order can yeild unique DBFS trees. }{3}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1} A. TRUE, for a finite graph.\newline  suppose a graph with V of finite size n. first, assume that every node points to at least one other node (the (out)deg(ALL VERTICIES) != 0). take a vertex out of V. It can't point to itself, so it has n-1 choices to point to. In this example, there are n verticies and at least n edges. The edge set contains an edge $(u,v)$ where $u\not =v$. As the edges are enumerated, the last edge (one that doesn't have an outdegree), will have have an empty verticie set to point to and this resulting edge must create a cycle. If the last vertex did not point to anything (it has an (out)deg == 0, the graph remains a DAG and we are left with one vertex, u, where $deg(u), == 0 $ }{4}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.3} C. TRUE\newline  see questions 1.C. the arguement shows that, in the addition of vertex, there will always be a last "vertex" that must point to another node which would cause a cycle. If all verticies belong to some outgoing edge, there are n edges but n-1 nodes to point to. 1 edge remains and this edge results in a cycle. }{4}}
